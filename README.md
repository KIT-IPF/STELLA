We introduce a new dataset [STELLA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cxkB6OB_vUkszVOANeU8848njFiuxY2W/view?usp=drive_link) (obSTaclE, occLusion and visibiLity constrAints) for image-based 3D reconstruction. The dataset consists of real-world challenging scenarios concerning transparent (*Window*) and non-transparent (*Vegetation*) obstacles. For comparability and assessing the impact of occlusions to the pose estimation we also include a scenario without visibility obstructions (*Original*). The object behind obstacles is 0.7m tall Buddha statue placed on a rectangular plate. All scenarios are captured using high resolution digital camera in a circular trajectory and each scenario contains 125 images. The ground truth data in the form of a mesh with 0.1mm accuracy is obtained using Structured Light.
