We introduce a new benchmark dataset [STELLA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cxkB6OB_vUkszVOANeU8848njFiuxY2W/view?usp=drive_link) (obSTaclE, occLusion and visibiLity constrAins) for image-based 3D reconstruction. The dataset consists of real-world challenging scenarios concerning transparent and non-transparent obstacles. For comparability and assessing the impact of occlusions to the pose estimation we also include one scenario without visibility obstructions. The object behind obstacles is 0.7m tall Buddha statue placed on a rectangular plate. All scenarios are captured using high resolution digital camera. The images are captured in a circular trajectory and each scenario contains 125 images. The ground truth data in the form of a mesh with 0.1mm accuracy is obtained using Structured Light.
